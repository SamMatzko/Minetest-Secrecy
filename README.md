# Secrecy mod for [Minetest](https://minetest.net)

This mod is still under development, but aims to make all kinds of secret-room-related stuff, like hidden doors/trapdoors and one-way glass. A big part of Secrecy's goal is to include as many default node types as is possible and useful, to maximize the secrecy of your hidden rooms!
