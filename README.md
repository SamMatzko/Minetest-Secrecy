# Secrecy mod for [Minetest](https://minetest.net)

This mod is still under development, but aims to make all kinds of secret-room-related stuff, like hidden doors/trapdoors and one-way glass. A big part of Secrecy's goal is to include as many default node types as is possible and useful, to maximize the secrecy of your hidden rooms!

## Inspiration

This mod is inspired by, and borrows code ideas from [Abriglass](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/abriglass/) and [MyDoors](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Don/mydoors/). Both Abriglass and MyDoors contain lots more than just one-way glass and hidden doors.

## What's it got so far?

I've completed all the one-way glass pieces using the default textures. This includes one-way glass for all sides, and for the top and bottom as well, for secret floors and ceilings!

### One-way glass

Here is a list of all the default materials supported by the one-way glass:

- Acacia Wood
- Aspen Wood
- Cobblestone
- Desert Sandstone
- Desert Sandstone Block
- Desert Sandstone Brick
- Desert Stone
